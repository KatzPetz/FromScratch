# FromScratch

FromScratch is a modpack for Minetest which provides a way to generate most of resources from a single tree.

This modpack is heavily inspirated by the Ex Nihilo mod for Minecraft.

The mod `fs_sieve` is currently a fork of the `gravelsieve` mod by JoSt.

## Mods

### fs_barrel

Compost saplings to make dirt.

_Will also be able to contain fluids._ (TODO)

### fs_core

Core items and helper functions like:
- Dust
- Silk Mesh
- Silk Worm
- Infested Leaves

You can put a Silk Worm in Leaves to create Infested Leaves.

Once a Leave is fully infested, you can dig it to get String.

**Warning:** Silk Worms will propagate to neighbour Leaves.


### fs_crucible

### fs_sieve

Use a sieve to get ores from Gravel.
