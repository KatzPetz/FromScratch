# FromScratch

FromScratch is a modpack for Minetest which provides a way to generate most of resources from a single tree.

This modpack is heavily inspirated by the Ex Nihilo mod for Minecraft.

The mod `fs_sieve` is currently a fork of the `gravelsieve` mod by JoSt.

### Gameplay

Use a hammer to smash blocks:
- Cobble -> Gravel
- Gravel -> Sand

Use a sieve to get ores from Gravel and Sand.
